<h2>Release History</h2>
<h3>Version 1.2.1</h3>
<p>Physics</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug, which prohibited Toyota from leaving the Bahrain pitboxes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mod Deriver</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed <span class="caps">ENGINE</span> upgrades to be taken from the engine-owner vehicle.</li>
	<li><span class="caps">DRIVELINE</span> upgrades are now copied from the engine-owner vehicle as well.</li>
	<li>Added support for special values for LifetimeRPMBase and -Half to make them relative to max engine rpm.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2</h3>
<p>Tires</p>
<ul>
	<li>Traction control, the slip curves have been revised to eliminate wearing and heating of tires that are stationary. This change also makes tire wear and heat more consistent between drivers and driving styles. The difference was hugely excessive previously. This has unfortunately meant that the traction control has had to be slightly compromised. You may feel the need to go to a slightly weaker TC setting, as the slip angle at which TC activates has reduced.</li>
	<li>This has meant heating and wear rates of tires will have changed.</li>
	<li>Tire temperature now influenced more by track temperature than previously.</li>
	<li>Minor tire performance evolution over the course of the season.</li>
	<li>Ideal pressures have been altered slightly.</li>
	<li>Ideal camber angles should be slightly lower on average.</li>
	<li>Grip with wear has been revised to provide slightly lower first lap performance to the tires. The tire is fairly similar after 2 flying laps to the previous performance.</li>
	<li>Longitudinal peak slip has slightly less variance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Engine</p>
<ul>
	<li>Slightly less rotational inertia</li>
	<li>Harder to stall (using max idle throttle)</li>
	<li>(Slightly) improved launch control.</li>
	<li>Fuel economy now has a great variance between teams. With Cosworth and Ferrari using the most and Renault the lowest specific fuel consumption.</li>
	<li>Engine wear rates and lifetimes have been revised</li>
</ul>
<p>Teams</p>
<ul>
	<li>Toyota is slightly faster overall.</li>
	<li>Toro Rosso has been slowed to a more realistic performance.</li>
	<li>Fixed Ride height of Super Aguri</li>
</ul>
<p>Gears, brakes and others</p>
<ul>
	<li>Up- and down shift times and clutch-in times have been tweaked to make the car more stable on gear changes.</li>
	<li>The brake fade temperatures have been tweaked in accordance to new data.</li>
	<li>Some default setups have been improved.</li>
	<li>Various other minor tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>League Physics</p>
<ul>
	<li>Removed league pack upgrade</li>
	<li>Added a Mod-Deriver tool to create customized league editions (to be found under <cite>rFactor\ModData\<span class="caps">CTDP</span>\CTDP06\mod_deriver</cite>, read the readme from that folder for more info)</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed artefacts in T-Cam when riding Red Bull</li>
	<li>Fixed Dell logo on Bahrain livery of <span class="caps">BMW</span> Sauber, which shouldn&#8217;t have been there</li>
	<li>Fixed missing Panasonic logos on Toyota&#8217;s rear wing</li>
	<li>Fixed too dark textures on Toro Rosso in DX7 mode</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug on Trulli&#8217;s helmet</li>
</ul>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<ul>
	<li>ControlCenter doesn&#8217;t require Administrator rights anymore. The only exception is if your rFactor installation in the &#8220;Program Files&#8221; folder.</li>
	<li>Uninstaller won&#8217;t delete wrong files</li>
	<li>Removed unnecessary config files from the Installer</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<p>Physics</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tires, more compounds available for some tracks, some minor revisions to heating. Tires are very similar, but have slightly more differences per compound.</li>
	<li>New slip curve resolution for all cars, the main purpose was to improve the traction control system. However, the new slip curves enhance the driving experience as well to some extent.</li>
	<li>The new traction control works much more accurately, reducing its effect in high speed corners, and as a result new traction control settings in upgrades menu are available to match.</li>
	<li>Some of the upgrades for some teams had small mistakes: e.g. Red Bull rearwing range</li>
	<li>All engine RPM’s now match with what is said in the upgrades page.</li>
	<li>Engine boost mapping has been reversed (Boost 1 is max <span class="caps">RPM</span>, Boost 6 is race <span class="caps">RPM</span>, Boost 9 conservation). This makes the garage display and the shift lights more accurate.</li>
	<li>Minor improvement (in terms of realism) to engine life for some vehicles.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug to provide more power loss when slip-streaming another vehicle.</li>
	<li>The <span class="caps">HUD</span> shift light now automatically changes per track, although it can still be overridden by choosing an upgrade.</li>
	<li>Toyota, slightly tweaked suspension geometry.</li>
	<li>Suspension geometries are changed to possibly work better with LeoFFB, while not being compromised in any way.</li>
	<li>Not quite physics related, but new Leo <span class="caps">FFB</span> settings are included, which provide better force feedback.</li>
	<li>Setup notes contain suggested <span class="caps">RPM</span> for all cars now, you should have default setup loaded for this to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>League Physics</p>
<ul>
	<li>Engine is now Cosworth CA2006 Series 6 instead of the Series 2 engine, thus providing about 15bhp more.</li>
	<li>Traction control overrides now work in the league physics.</li>
	<li><span class="caps">HUD</span> shift light changes now work with league physics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added: Missing <span class="caps">DVD</span>-Cover</li>
	<li>Fixed: Williams: Crash in DirectX 8 caused by texture bugs</li>
	<li>Fixed: Renault: Mild Seven logo of right winglet reversed</li>
	<li>Fixed: Ferrari: Front wing logos and new Case logo on the nose, which was missing on the north-american liveries</li>
	<li>Fixed: Ferrari: Japanese rearwing texture, wrong color of lower plane</li>
	<li>Fixed: Super Aguri: Minor texture errors</li>
	<li>Fixed: Midland/Spyker: no Neutral decals on the texture</li>
	<li>Fixed: McLaren: Cockpit fin was missing</li>
</ul>
<p>Miscellaneous</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added: Manual translations in Italian, German and French</li>
	<li>Fixed: Crash after starting replay (bad MP3 encoding of music files)</li>
	<li>Fixed: Crash of ControlCenter on startup</li>
	<li>Fixed: Pit garage slots placement, the team order on some tracks was wrong</li>
	<li>Fixed: Installer overwriting realfeelplugin.ini, if you already have a realfeel-configuration, this will be kept.</li>
	<li>Updated: Extended credits list</li>
	<li>Improved: Soundpack by Michael Ode (new samples, high-samples improved, opponents quieter incar, external sounds slightly less agressive)
