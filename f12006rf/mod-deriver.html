<h1>CTDPF106 Mod Deriver</h1>

<p>
The Mod Deriver serves as a replacement for the league physics pack. You can freely define,
what physics your vehicles use and can even customize them. It it also possible to give some
cars the physics of the Renault and some of the Ferrari or something.<br />
Customize and derive your own league mod to get the best competition for all participants.<br />
<u>Track upgrades will still work in your derived mod.</u>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
<strong>Mod Name</strong><br />
The name, that will be displayed in the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>RFM Name</strong><br />
Filename for the RFM
</p>
<p>
<strong>Vehicle Folder Name</strong><br />
Folder name, where to place the derived vehicles. This folder will be created under GameData\Vehicles\CTDP\CTDP.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Vehicle Filter Class</strong><br />
The vehicle class for the derived vehicles. This must be unique and must differ from &quot;CTDPF1_2006&quot;
</p>
<p>
<strong>Allow All Tire Compounds</strong><br />
If this is set, all 2*10 compounds are available in setups instead of only the ones for regular track upgrades.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Parc Ferme Setups</strong><br />
If this is set, only small parts of the setup are modifiable between qualifying and race (like fuel, which is not).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Parc Ferme Tires</strong><br />
The given amount of drivers will start with used tires into the race.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Max Opponents</strong><br />
The maximum number of allowed opponents.
</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Custom Engines</h2>
<p>
Here you can define custom engines, that you can assign to custom physics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Name</strong><br />
The name for the new custom engine. It must be unique and differ from the original names.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Base</strong><br />
The original engine to base off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Launch Efficiency</strong><br />
Efficiency (0.0-1.0) of launch control, or 0.0 if N/A. -1.0 will use the original value from the base engine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lifetime RPM Base</strong><br />
First value of the LifetimeEngineRPM setting. Base engine speed for lifetime. -1.0 will use the original value from the base engine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lifetime RPM Half</strong><br />
Second value of the LifetimeEngineRPM setting. Range where lifetime is halved. -1.0 will use the original value from the base engine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lifetime Average</strong><br />
Average lifetime in seconds. -1 will use the original value from the base engine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Lifetime Variance</strong><br />
Lifetime random variance. -1 will use the original value from the base engine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Central</strong><br />
If checked, the engine ini file will be placed in the vehicles folder instead of the specific folder for the using vehicle.
This clarifies, that the engine is the same for all using vehicles.
</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Custom Vehicle Physics</h2>
<p>
Here you can define custom vehicle physics, that you can assign to derived vehicles.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Name</strong><br />
The name for the new custom engine. It must be unique and differ from the original names.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Base</strong><br />
The original vehicle to base physics off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tire Brand</strong><br />
The tire brand to use for these vehicle physics.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fuel Tank Size</strong><br />
The size in liters of the vehicle's fuel tank. -1 will use the original value from the base vehicle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Draft Factor</strong><br />
This is a manipulation factor for draft (dirty air) effects. The following settings are affected.
<ul>
    <li>FRONTWING / FWDraftLiftMult</li>
    <li>REARWING / RWDraftLiftMult</li>
    <li>LEFTFENDER / FenderDraftLiftMult</li>
    <li>RIGHTFENDER / FenderDraftLiftMult</li>
    <li>BODYAERO / BodyDraftLiftMult</li>
    <li>DIFFUSER / DiffuserDraftLiftMult</li>
</ul>
Each original value is manipulated using the following math.<br />
v is the original value for one setting.<br />
f is the draft factor.<br />
v' is the resulting value.<br />
v' = ( ( v - 1.0 ) * f ) + 1.0<br />
This means, a value of 1.0 leaves all original values unchanged. 0.0 sets all new values to 1.0, which means no draft effect.
Values smaller than zero will make the value go below 1.0.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Engine</strong><br />
The engine to use for this vehicle type.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Central</strong><br />
If checked, the vehicle HDV file will be placed in the vehicles folder instead of the specific folder for the using vehicle.
This clarifies, that the HDV is the same for all using vehicles. Central here also forces central for the used engine.
</p>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Vehicle Derivations</h2>
<p>
Here you can define derived vehicles, that will be drivable in the game using the derived mod.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Name</strong><br />
The new name for the derived vehicle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Physics</strong><br />
The physics to use for the derived vehicle. This can be an original car or a custom one.
</p>
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to derive a league mod is to add all teams to the bottom list and give tham all the same original physics.
There are predefined league derivation configurations shipped with this tool. Just load the xml files from this folder and
use them.
</p>

<p>
<h2>One click install</h2>
There are two ways to derive a (pre-)defined derivation mod. One way is to hand the saved xml file to your league members
and tell them to load the file with the Mod Deriver by doubleclicking the jar file and loading the file. Then they just have
to click on &quot;Derive&quot; and wait a few minutes until the &quot;Ready.&quot; message appears in the log.<br />
The other way is to create a batch file with the following content.
<pre>
@java -jar ctdp06_mod_deriver.jar --config-file YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.xml --gui-less
@pause
</pre>
Then give this batch (.cmd) file to your drivers, tell them to put it into the mod_deriver folder and execute it.
</p>

<p>
<h2>Deleting a derived mod</h2>
If your derived mod has &quot;F1CTDP06_My_Derived_Mod&quot; as &quot;Vehicle Folder Name&quot; and &quot;RFM Name&quot;, you just have
to go into the rfm folder of your rFactor installation and delete the four files<br />
F1CTDP06_My_Derived_Mod.bik<br />
F1CTDP06_My_Derived_Mod.rfm<br />
F1CTDP06_My_Derived_Mod.tga<br />
F1CTDP06_My_Derived_Mod_logo.tga<br />
And then delete the folder &quot;GameData\Vehicles\CTDP\CTDP\F1CTDP06_My_Derived_Mod&quot; and all of its contents and you're through.

<p>
<strong>Have fun! :-)</strong><br />
